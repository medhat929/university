This web application, developed with PHP and SQL, provides a user-friendly interface for viewing and editing student profiles. It allows administrators to access and modify student data such as names, courses, and grades. The application features robust search functionality, data filters, and secure login systems for data protection. I did this as solution to a student assignment for https://www.programminghomeworkhelp.com/web-development-assignment/
